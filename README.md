Dublin Tourist Attraction | Location Based Service (LBS) Application to locate tourist attractions in the Dublin, Ireland area.

Features:

Allows users to sign up with their details and input their location or choose it to be automatically detected using GeoLocation API.

Access to a database with over 900 tourist attractions and their exact geographical locations as well as other available details.

Registered users are shown a list of the 20 tourist attractions closest to their location.


Note:

I attempted to deploy the application, as stated in the CA requirements, using Docker and further deploying it online, following through with the available lab tutorials.
Even though I followed every lab instruction to perfection I encountered many errors which I could not solve.
I spent the last couple of days past the official deadline attempting to resolve this issue but decided to push the app to GitHub and display it running locally on my machine.

I have included a screenshots folder to display the functionality of the app as it currently stands, and will continue to update it in my free time to try resolve the
issues regarding Docker and cloud deployment.
